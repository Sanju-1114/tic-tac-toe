## Customization & Improvements

This project is designed to be easily editable. Here are some ways you can make it your own:

* **Update the Logo:** Replace `assets/logo.png` with your own branding.
* **Theming:** Modify `tic-tac-toe.css` to change the color scheme (e.g., Neon mode, Dark mode).
* **UI Overhaul:** Since it uses Bootstrap, you can easily swap utility classes to change the layout.
* **Expand Logic:** Add a "Player vs Computer" mode in `tic-tac-toe.js`.

* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For layout and responsiveness.
